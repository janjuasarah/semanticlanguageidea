Ideas:

-universal healthcare database : maybe the ekg/other monitors automatically record to remove doctor error

-medications that you are taking and checking if they will react together / cross reference database 

-education equivelency reference database, to avoid you having to transfer your transcripts yourself all the time/would speed up registration process (THIS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE IDEA, AS WHAT LANGUAGE WOULD BE TRANSLATED ISN'T REALLY CLEAR)
